## Why make a word processor?


There seems to be few standalone hobby projects that one can attempt anymore.  Everything is so interconnected.  It isn't far into a design before it becomes clear that the project must interface with Spotify or Instagram or Microsoft Powerpoint.  Personally, I find programming is great when the problem lies within logic or code.  However, I find it quickly becomes cumbersome when the problem lies in tackling some man-made API or specification.

The challenge of creating a word processor presents a standalone project.  While an advanced processor would benefit from interfacing with other office programs, those programs could also be invented as part of the project.  I don't say that flippantly.  My chances of successfully creating a usable word processor are close to none.

I like the idea of making a _browser-based_ word processor.  It could run instantly on any device, free of charge, without any of the horrible tracking or privacy issues of current products.  It also helps that current leading products are truly infuriating to use, so I enjoy the prospect of writing one that works.  Again, I don't say that flippantly.  The chance of me actually fixing four-decade old problems are also zero.
