## Why make a word processor?


There seems to be few standalone hobby projects that one can attempt anymore.  Everything is so interconnected.  Not long into a design before does it become clear that the project must interface with Spotify or Instagram or Microsoft Powerpoint etc.  Personally, I find programming is great when the problem lies within logic or code but quickly becomes cumbersome when the problem lies in tackling some man-made API or specification.

The challenge of creating a word processor presents a standalone project.  While an advanced processor would indeed benefit from interfacing with other office programs, those programs could also be invented as part of the project.  I don't say that flippantly.  My chances of successfully creating a usable word processor are close to none.

I like the idea of making a browser-based word processor.  It could run instantly on any device, free of charge, without any of the horrible tracking or privacy issues of current products.  Current leading products are also rather infuriating to use, so I enjoy the prospect of writing one that works.  Again, I don't say that flippantly.  The chance of me actually fixing four-decade old problems are also zero.
